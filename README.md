## Timely climbing gym booking information for Singapore. 

When COVID-19 hit, many climbing gyms in Singapore adopted slot-booking systems in order to ensure safe climbing.

Climbing with our group of friends became difficult to organise as we didn't know which gyms had enough capacity, unless we tediously checked each of their booking sites ahead of time.

**We built [Climbwhere.sg](https://climbwhere.sg) to help with that.** The website shows aggregated climbing gym slot information and provides some useful filters. Currently, [our scraper](https://github.com/triomic/pocket) only supports the following gyms:

* Boulder +
* BFF Climb
* Oyeyo
* Z-Vertigo
* ~~Lighthouse~~ (Removed by owners' request).
* Boulder World
* Fit Bloc

As long as this remains the new norm, we'll continue to improve Climbwhere.

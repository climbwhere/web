# Climbwhere.sg - Timely climbing gym booking information for Singapore. 
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f24978be-65f1-41ef-9743-0691952d8a68/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elastic-franklin-9a8023/deploys)

This website shows aggregated climbing gym slot information from multiple bouldering gyms in Singapore.

With many new gyms opening up and the surging demand for climbing, looking for open/less-crowded timeslots has become a very arduous process. We made this site to help with that.

## Supported gyms

* Boulder +
* BFF Climb
* Oyeyo
* Z-Vertigo
* ~~Lighthouse~~ (Removed by owners' request).
* Boulder World
* Fit Bloc
* The Rock School
* Boulder Planet
* Boulder Movement (Downtown, Rochor, Tai Seng)



## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

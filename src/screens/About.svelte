  <h3>Why does this exist?</h3>
  <p>
    When COVID-19 hit, many climbing gyms in Singapore adopted slot-booking
    systems in order to ensure safe climbing. Climbing with our group of friends
    became difficult to organise as we didn't know which gyms had enough
    capacity, unless we tediously checked each of their booking sites ahead of
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>We built Climbwhere.sg to help with that.</b> The website shows aggregated
    climbing gym slot information from multiple climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore.
  </p>

  <h3>Where is this data from?</h3>
  <p>
    We retrieve gym slot information directly from the respective gyms' websites
    every 2 minutes or so. Data is not guaranteed to be accurate or up to date. <Link

    >.
  </p>

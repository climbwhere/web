    When COVID-19 hit, many climbing gyms in Singapore adopted slot-booking
    systems in order to limit capacity and reduce risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the high demand, it can be very tedious to search for open time slots
    across all gyms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>We built Climbwhere.sg to help with that.</b> The website shows aggregated
    climbing gym slot information from multiple climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore.
  </p>

  <h3>Where is this data from?</h3>
  <p>
    We retrieve gym slot information directly from the respective gyms' websites
    every 2 minutes or so. Data is not guaranteed to be accurate or up to date. <Link

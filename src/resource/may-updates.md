## Climbwhere is shutting down (May 2022)

With effect from **25th May, gym slot information will no longer be posted on [Climbwhere.sg](http://Climbwhere.sg) and the Climbwhere Telegram bot. This comes as most climbing gyms no longer require bookings for gym entry.**

Climbwhere was created as a side project in 2021. It was visited 13.6k times, with around 500 monthly users at its peak.

We enjoyed working on this project and appreciate all the support and encouragement from the community. The source code is available and open-sourced on Github [here](https://github.com/climbwhere/web).
